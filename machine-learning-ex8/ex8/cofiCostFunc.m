% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the cost function and gradient for collaborative
%               filtering. Concretely, you should first implement the cost
%               function (without regularization) and make sure it is
%               matches our costs. After that, you should implement the 
%               gradient and use the checkCostFunction routine to check
%               that the gradient is correct. Finally, you should implement
%               regularization.
%
% Notes: X - num_movies  x num_features matrix of movie features
%        Theta - num_users  x num_features matrix of user features
%        Y - num_movies x num_users matrix of user ratings of movies
%        R - num_movies x num_users matrix, where R(i, j) = 1 if the 
%            i-th movie was rated by the j-th user
%
% You should set the following variables correctly:
%
%        X_grad - num_movies x num_features matrix, containing the 
%                 partial derivatives w.r.t. to each element of X
%        Theta_grad - num_users x num_features matrix, containing the 
%                     partial derivatives w.r.t. to each element of Theta
%

t1 = (Theta*X')';
t2 = (t1-Y).^2;
t3 = t2(R==1); % only when movie has been rated.
temp = sum(t3(:));
J = (1/2) * (temp);

temp1 = ((Theta*X')' - Y);
temp1(find(R==0)) = 0; % only when movie has been rated.
X_grad =  temp1 * Theta;
Theta_grad = temp1' * X; 
% =============================================================

grad = [X_grad(:); Theta_grad(:)];
